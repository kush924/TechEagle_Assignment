        The Time taken by LEDControl function(disabling Interrupts) is 1400us.
        When entering the LEDControl function the UART buffer must be completely 
        empty or just at the verge of completing the reception of one data frame
        (taking the worst case senerio).

        when the LEDControl function is about to end(enabling Interrupts), and 
        taking the worst case senerio above, we can receive that initial data frame
        in the buffer(at the start of LEDControl) t = 0, then receive another data
        frame in the next depth of the buffer t = t_frame, then just moments(neglegible)
        after finishing LEDControl, we can receive a new data frame again hence at
        t = 2 * t_frame = 1400us.

        The Serial Bytes are of 8-N-1 format hence the number of bits transfered for
        each byte of data is 10(one stop and one receive bits) 1+8+1. The data is
        contiguous hence there is no idle bits/time between each data frame, hence
        stop bit is followed by the start bit of the next data frame.

        Hence t_frame = 10 * t_bit

    from above Equations:
        20 * t_bit = 1400us
    hence
        t_bit = 70us

    Baudrate = gross bit rate, The symbols used are simple binary hence
    Baudrate = bits per second

        Baudrate = 1 / t_bit = 14285.71
        MAX_Baudrate(theoretical) = 14285
